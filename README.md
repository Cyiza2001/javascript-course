# javascript-course in this repository there is a game that you can play with your friend basing on the random dice number you picked , if you pick the random dice number that is equal to one the game is switched to the other player and your current scores are lost, however to avoid this you might choose to hold your current scores so that it may be added to your total scores, note that holding the current scores also switches the game to the next player, lastly when one holds his scores and the total scores are greater or equal to twenty he's going to win the game.
